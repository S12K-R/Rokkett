Simple 2-view shopping cart

First project. A two-view basic shopping cart

It is really simple, mainly for delegation and communication between views practice. It has an array of dummy products with a price and a counter for the amount, when adding a product to the shopping cart, the amount added is substracted from the stock eliminating the row when the stock goes to zero.

In the shopping cart, a total price label is set with the added amount of the products. The "Delete" button allows to delete items adding them back to the product list stock and recreating the row if it was eliminated due to the stock counter dropping to zero.
